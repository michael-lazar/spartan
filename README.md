# ðŸ’ª Spartan Protocol

> spartan:// is a client-to-server protocol designed for hobbyists. Spartan draws on ideas from gemini, gopher, and http to create something new, yet familiar. It strives to be simple, fun, and inspiring.
>
> Spartan sends ASCII-encoded, plaintext requests over TCP. Arbitrary text and binary files are supported for both upload and download. Like gemini, the default hypertext document in spartan is text/gemini. A special line type ("=:") is used to prompt for input. Spartan has four status codes: "success", "redirect", "server error", and "client error".
>
> Spartan is not opinionated about how or what you use it for, only that you have fun doing so!
